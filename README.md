🔑 Password Reset Flow

Backend generates a token and sends reset link via Nodemailer.

User clicks link → React ResetPassword page opens (/reset-password/:token).

User enters new password → backend validates token & updates password.

📬 Nodemailer Setup
Enable 2-Step Verification in Gmail.

Generate an App Password (16 characters, no spaces).

Use that in .env as EMAIL_PASSWORD.
